# Safety & Responsible Use

_Last updated: 2025-09-08_

Screen recording can capture **personal, confidential, or copyrighted** content. To protect yourself and others, follow these rules:

## 1. Consent & Lawful Use
- **Obtain explicit consent** from all parties before recording content that includes their voice, image, screen, or personal data.
- **Comply with local laws** on recording, privacy, intellectual property, and employment. You are responsible for legal compliance where you use the app.
- **Do not use for surveillance**, stalking, harassment, or any unlawful monitoring.

## 2. Sensitive & Protected Content
- **Do not record** payment data, credentials, government IDs, health or childrenâ€™s data unless it is **strictly necessary** and you have **lawful basis and consent**.
- **Respect DRM and app terms**: Some apps/services prohibit recording. If an app blocks recording, do not attempt to bypass.

## 3. Children & Minors
- Do not record minors without **verifiable parental or legal guardian consent** and appropriate safeguards.

## 4. Workplace & Third-Party Devices
- If recording on an employer-managed or third-party device/account, follow your **workplace policies** and obtain **written permission** if required.

## 5. Data Handling & Security
- Store recordings **locally by default**. If you share or back up to cloud services, review their privacy and security.
- **Review recordings** before sharing to avoid unintentionally exposing private data.
- **Delete** recordings you no longer need.

## 6. Safety Disclaimers
